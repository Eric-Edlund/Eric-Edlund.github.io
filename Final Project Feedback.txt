For Kevin Hulem:

    Make sure all your code is inside either body or header. Strange that it's currently working.

    Inconsistent colors, white background doesn't scream heavy metal, the text is red, the table is blue, the table text is black. Find a website color picker

    The page doesn't have a clear purpose. Why is the user there? Use this to better lay it out. See Apple's page where they sell the iPhone. The layout feeds information in an order that makes sense for what they're trying to communicate

    The click me to send message button doesn't need to work, but it should be put somewhere on the page that contextually makes sense. Right now it's the first thing on the page. Who am I sending a message to? Where do I type the message? Why would I send a message?

    I think the assignment may require some more content. Have some other pages with links to them, write some paragraphs maybe. Create an about page.
