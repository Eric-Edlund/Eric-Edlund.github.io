            The content of a webpage is stored in Hyper 
            Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML code is stored 
            in plain text files ending in <q>.html</q>. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="Elements">Elements</h2>
        
        <p>An HTML document is a collection of Elements, each notated with an opening tag, 
            like <code text="<element>"></code>, and a matching closing tag,
            like <code text="</element>"></code>. 
            An element represents a <strong>thing</strong>.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different types of elements (things) that you 
            can have on your website (currently, this html document).
            What type of element you have is specified in the opening and 
            closing tags. A <code t="<cat></cat>"></code>, for example, 
            could be a <i>cat</i> element, while <code t="<dog></dog>"></code>
            could represent a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something very important to notice is that
            <code t="<cat></dog>"></code> does not constitute an element.
            Upon arriving a line like this, a web browser (the thing 
            drawing your website!) would have no idea what you were 
            saying. Closing tags need to match opening ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code t="<!--...-->"></code> can be used to create single line comments.
            Comments are ignored by the browser and don't appear on your website.
        </p>

        <h2 id="NestedElements">Nested Elements</h2>

        <p>
            Elements may contain other elements in a parent-child relationship.
            This is done by putting an element between the opening and 
            closing tags of another. One parent element (the enclosing one)
            may contain multiple children. Naturally, an element can 
            only have one parent.
        </p>

        <code-example example="nesting_elements"></code-example>
        <p>
            This cat element contains a heart, two lungs, and 
            the defining characteristic of a cat. The cat's organs 
            belong to it, and are considered <q>siblings</q>
            to each other.

        <h2 id="ComponentsOfAWebPage">Components of a Web Page</h2>

        <p>
            For an html file to be a proper website, there are 
            a few important elements it needs to have. Firstly, 
            <code t="<!DOCTYPE html>"></code> needs to appear 
            at the top of the document. This tells the browser what 
            it's looking at. Under that, you need an 
            <code>html</code> element.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code t="<html></html>"></code> will contain all the 
            information about the web page. Its has two children:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The <code>head</code> element
                    contains data <i>about</i>
                 the website: what language it's in, what should 
                 be displayed on the tab. Nothing in the <code>head</code>
                 will be displayed on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>body</code> contains 
                    the content <i>on</i>
                    the page. Its children hold text,
                    images, links, videos and whatever else
                    your site has on it.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <code-example example="basic_html"></code-example>

        <p>
            Inside the <code>head</code>, you can see the 
            <code>title</code> element. <code>title</code> contains 
            the text to be displayed on the site's tab
            (for this site, <q>WebDev Tutorial</q>). Note that 
            in the text inside the element, 
            <code><q>Text Displayed on the Tab</q></code>, spaces will 
            be preserved. This is only true for single spaces:
            tabs, multiple spaces and newlines are trimmed.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the <code>body</code>, there is only 1 element:
            a paragraph element, notated as just <code>p</code>.
            Paragraphs will format their text to make it look 
            like a parargaph. <code>p</code> is, again, one of 
            many many different elements in html you can use. 
            Paragraph for example will format its text to have 
            the normal font size and appear like a paragraph.
        </p>

            An IDE like
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> 
            is <strong>highly recommended</strong> as it will bring
            non-obvious issues in your HTML code 
            to your attention. It will prevent you from spending an hour
            searching over your code trying to figure out why it won't 
            work and then realizing it was because you forgot to put 
            a <q><code>"</code></q>, or close an element, or some other insignificant 
            detail you shouldn't spend time thinking about.
            Frequently, it will also be able to explain your mistake and 
            offer a solution to fix it. Your IDE will be like a set of 
            training wheels for now,
            and provide other powerful tools to you later.

            There are a hundred IDEs out there, and just like 
            spirit animals and wands, you have to find yours.
