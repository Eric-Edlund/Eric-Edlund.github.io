            The content of a webpage is stored in Hyper 
            Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML code is stored 
            in plain text files ending in <q>.html</q>. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="Elements">Elements</h2>
        
        <p>An HTML document is a collection of Elements, each notated with an opening tag, 
            like <code text="<element>"></code>, and a matching closing tag,
            like <code text="</element>"></code>. 
            An element is really just a <strong>thing</strong>.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different types of elements (things) that you 
            can have on your website (currently, this html document).
            What type of element you have is specified in the opening and 
            closing tags. A <code t="<cat></cat>"></code>, for example, 
            could be a <i>cat</i> element, while <code t="<dog></dog>"></code>
            could represent a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something very important to notice is that
            <code t="<cat></dog>"></code> does not constitute an element.
            Upon arriving a line like this, a web browser (the thing 
            drawing your website!) would have no idea what you were 
            saying. Closing tags need to match opening ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, the <code t="cat"></code> element isn't a part 
            of the HTML standard, and so a web browser wouldn't 
            know what to do with it if you used one.
        </p>

        <p>
            For an html file to be a proper website, there are 
            a few important elements it needs to have. Firstly, 
            <code t="<!DOCTYPE html>"></code> needs to appear 
            at the top of the document. This tells the browser what 
            it's looking at. Under that, you need an 
            <code>html</code> element. In HTML, spaces, indentation 
            and new lines don't affect how the document will be read,
            so you should use those things to produce an organized, 
            human readable document. As long as the <code>html</code>
            element appears after that heading, it should work.
        </p>

        <h2>Nested Elements</h2>

        <p>
            The <code>html</code> element will contain all the 
            information about the web page. Inside the html element,
            between it's opening and closing tags, you may put other 
            nested elements. Elements inside other elements take on a 
            parent-child relationship. The elements inside an 
            element are that element's children, and the element 
            surrounding a child element is its parent. An element 
            can have multiple children (who are siblings to each other).
        </p>

        <p>
            The html element of a website has two important children:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The <code text="<head></head>"></code> element
                    contains data <i>about</i>
                 the website, like what language it's in and what should 
                 be displayed on the tab. Nothing in the <code>head</code>
                 will be displayed on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code text="<body></body>"></code> contains 
                    the content <i>on</i>
                    the page. Its children hold text,
                    images, links, videos and whatever else
                    your site has on it.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's what this all starts to look like:
        </p>

        <code-example example="basic_html"></code-example>

        <p>
            Inside the <code>head</code> element, you can see the 
            <code>title</code> element. <code>title</code> contains 
            the text to be displayed on the site's tab. Note that 
            in the text inside the <code>title</code> element, 
            <code>Text Displayed on the Tab</code>, spaces will 
            be preserved. The message will appear exactly how it 
            looks in the html. This is only true for single spaces.
            Tabs, multiple spaces and newlines are trimmed.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the <code>body</code>, there is only 1 element.
            The first thing, <code t="<!--...-->"></code>, is 
            a comment. It's contents will be ignored by the browser
            and its only there for humans to make notes.
            The element that the browser will see is the 
            paragraph element, notated as just <code>p</code>.
            Paragraphs will format their text to make it look 
            like a parargaph. <code>p</code> is, again, one of 
            many many different elements in html you can use.
            There are far too many to cover, but I'll go over 
            some of them in the next topic.

            An IDE like
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> 
            is <strong>highly recommended</strong> as it will bring small,
            non-obvious yet frustrating issues in your html code 
            to your attention. It will prevent you from spending an hour
            searching over your code trying to figure out why it won't 
            work and then realizing it was because you forgot to put 
            a <q>"</q>, or close an element, or some other insignificant 
            detail you shouldn't spend time thinking about.
            Frequently, it will also be able to explain your mistake and 
            offer a solution to fix it. Your IDE will be like a set of 
            training wheels for now,
            and provide other powerful tools to you later.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a hundred IDEs out there, and just like 
            spirit animals and wands, you have to find yours.

            Your webpage (currently just a file ending in .html) can be
            opened with a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge,
            Brave or Opera. If you are reading this tutorial, you're on a 
            web browser!
            Open your page by right clicking your HTML file and selecting 
            <q>Open with...</q> and picking a browser.
        </p>

            Note the importance of the closing <code text="</tag>"></code>. If you forget to
