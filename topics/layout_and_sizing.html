        <h1>Layout and Sizing</h1>

        <p>
            The size and position of elements on the screen is a collaboration between 
            the html and css. 
            While HTML allows for grouping and insertion based ordering,
            css gives us far greater control over how the browser arranges the page.
        </p>

        <h2 id="InternalSpacing">Internal Spacing</h2>

        <p>
            An element is given space to fill by it's parent. It may choose to use 
            as much of this space as it wants.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The outermost space an element controls is its margins.
            The margin is the space between the outside of the element 
            and the element's border.

        </p>

        <div class="visualpreview" style="width: fit-content;">
            <button style="margin: 5px; padding: 10px; background-color: aqua; color: green; border: black 2px dashed;">
                Content
            </button>
        </div>

        <p>
            The white space is the margin. Many elements have a default margin, 
            but for this one, I specified <code>margin: 5px</code> set the width 
            to 5 pixels for the top, bottom, left, and right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between the border and the inner content (the text) is the padding.
            I set <code>padding: 10px;</code> putting 10 pixels between the content 
            and the border. You can specify the padding or margin for just one side 
            with <code>margin-top</code> and <code>padding-top</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Margin collapse is something the browser will do to adjacent elements
            in some situations. It will reduce the total margin between them to the 
            greatest of the two. So if you have two buttons next to eachother with 
            <code>margin: 1em;</code>, the total space separating the buttons will 
            be <code>1em</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If an element doesn't have enough space to show all its content, 
            the content will be drawn outside the content box by default.
        </p>

        <div class="visualpreview">
            <div style="background-color: lightgray; height: 10ch; padding: 1ch;">
                <div style="background-color: green; height: 15ch; width: 20%; border: black 1px solid;">

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            Note that the space the green box occupies outside the gray one is 
            not accounted for when arranging elements on the screen. I had to 
            put extra spacing under the gray box so the green didn't cover any text.
        </p>
        <p>
            By setting
            <code>overflow: visible | hidden | scroll | auto</code> attribute,
            you can override default behavior. <code>auto</code> will show 
            the scroll bars if there isn't sufficient space. <code>hidden</code>
            won't show the scroll bars, clipping the content inside the box.
            <code>scroll</code> will show the bars even when they're not necessary.
            <code>visible</code> is the default.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>auto</code>:
        </p>

        <div class="visualpreview">
            <div style="background-color: lightgray; height: 10ch; padding: 1ch; overflow: auto;">
                <div style="background-color: green; height: 15ch; width: 20%; border: black 1px solid;">

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="Dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
        <p>
            You can specify the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of an element 
            with length values. There are a lot of different length units in css. 
            I specified the padding and margins in the example from the above section
            in terms of pixels: <code>5px</code>. Something to considers about this is 
            that not all devices have the same sized pixels. I'm making this page on 
            a 144dpi laptop screen, but many modern phones have a pixel density of over 
            500 dpi. On those devices, that content label is going to look very small.
        </p>
<!--https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units-->
        <p>
            You can specify distance in other absolute units, like centimeters 
            (<code>cm</code>) or inches (<code>in</code>), or in relative units, 
            <code>ch</code>, the width of the '0' character in the current font, 
            <code>vw</code>, 1% of the viewport's width, or <code>em</code>, 
            the size of the font of the parent element. Relative units <code>em</code>
            are generally good to use because the browser knows how big fonts need 
            to be for the user to read them. If we make everything relative to that,
            it will be a usable size.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use percentages as a relative unit of length also. Setting an 
            attribute to a percent will be relative to the parent element's value 
            for that attribute. For example, setting the width of a child 
            <code>width: 50%;</code> will make its width dynamically adjust to 
            half its parents. If you resize the parent element, the child will 
            resize also. You can resize your browser window to see this happening 
            below.

        <h2 id="Layouts">Layouts</h2>

        <p>
            An element's <code>display</code> property determines how it will 
            layout its children, and
            sometimes, how it 
            should be treated by its parent.
        </p>

        <h3>Flow Layout</h3>

        <p>
            By default, elements layout their children using the Flow Layout.
            Elements in a flow layout are either block or inline. Inline elements, 
            like <a href="www.google.com">links</a>, will be drawn in-line with other content.
            By default, 
            <code>a { display: inline; }</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paragraphs are instead drawn one on top of the other because a paragraph 
            has the <code>block</code> display value. If you set 
            <code>p { display: inline; }</code>, then paragraphs wouldn't be 
            separated like  hthis.
        </p>

        <img style="float: right; width: 50%;" src="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1990393_vCjgs.jpg" alt="sponge bob meme about css floats">

        <p>
            The <code>float</code> attribute can be set on block elements inside 
            a flow layout. Making an image <code>float: right;</code> will move it to 
            the right side of the parent and make text (and other inline elements) 
            flow around it.
            
        </p>

        <p style="column-count: 2">
            <code>column-count</code> can be applied to a flow layout element 
            to control how many columns the inline children will use. Also see 
            <code>column-gap</code>, <code>column-width</code> and 
            <code>columns</code> in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns#reference">Mozilla's Documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Display values of 
            <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code> don't affect how their element 
            will organize its children. Those two values only matter when the parent 
            element is using the Flow Layout. There are other values of <code>display</code>
            that DO affect how their element's children are layed out.
        </p>

        

        <h3>Flex Layout</h3>

        <p>
            <code>display: flex;</code> tells an element to arrange it's children along one dimension, 
            ignoring their <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code> properties.


        </p>

        <div>
            <h4>Flow Layout</h3>
            <div class="visualpreview">
                <p>
                    Paragraph 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 3
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Flex Box Layout</h3>
            <div class="visualpreview" style="display: flex;">
                <p>
                    Paragraph 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 3
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The <code t="<div style='display: flex;'>"></code> element above is 
                organizing it's elements in a row. This is the default behavior, 
                and orientation can be set with <code>flex-direction: row;</code>
                or <code>flex-direction: column;</code>:
        </p>

        <h4>Also Flex Box Layout</h3>
        <div class="visualpreview" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
            <p>
                Paragraph 1
            </p>
            <p>
                Paragraph 2
            </p>
            <p>
                Paragraph 3
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Also notice that the white boxes holding the example are both treated by 
            this article's body to be using the 
            <code>block</code> layout, even though some of them have <code>display: flex;</code>.
            On the outside, <code>flex</code> elements are blocks. It's also possible to have 
            an inline flex element, specified <code>display: inline-flex;</code>:
            <div id="inlineflex" class="visualpreview" style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;">
                <style>
                    #inlineflex > p {
                        margin: 0;
                    }
                </style>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 3
                </p>
            </div>
            This flexbox is inline in this paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>
            The children of a flex container become flex items. 
            In the above examples where the flex container was wider than all the 
            flex items could fill, the flex items 
            didn't expand to fill the space. To allow an item to expand 
            to fill any extra space, specify <code>flex: 1;</code> on it.
            If multiple items have this specified, they will share the extra space 
            propertionately to their <code>flex-grow</code> value specifed by 
            <code>flex: number;</code>
        </p>

        <div class="visualpreview" style="display: flex">
            <button>
                flex: 0; (default)
            </button>
            <button>
                flex: 0;
            </button>
            <button style="flex: 1">
                flex: 1;
            </button>
        </div>

        <h3 id="GridLayout">Grid Layout</h3>
        <p>
            <code>display: grid;</code> is like a 2d flex container.
            You define the rows and columns the grid has with 
            <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code>,
            each taking a space separated list of lengths.
        </p>

        <code-example example="grid_layout"></code-example>

        <p>
            Notice the unit <code>fr</code> which represents one fraction of 
            the available space. 
        </p>

        <!--https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction-->
        <style>
            #gridexample1 {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr;
                grid-template-rows: 100px 150px;
                gap: 10px;
            }
        </style>

        <div class="visualpreview" id="gridexample1">
            <button>1</button>
            <button>2</button>
            <button>3</button>
            <button>4</button>
            <button>5</button>
            <button>6</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            The elements inside a grid layout element will automatically be placed 
            into the grid. You can alternatively specify <code>grid-row</code> and 
            <code>grid-column</code> in each element's style. The first space is the top 
            left (1, 1). Values may include a range of spaces, like 
            <code>grid-column: 1 / 2;</code> which will fill the first and second 
            columns.
        </p>

        <h3>Centering Things</h3>
        <h4>Horizontally</h4>
        <p>
            To center the inline content of an element using flow layout, set the 
            <code>text-align</code> property. Block elements will always take the full 
            width, so they have to center their own content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flex box and grid layouts give their children the full space they demand
            through <code>flex-grow</code> or their grid dimensions. Content inside the 
            children is centered normally. 
        </p>

        <h4>Veritcally</h4>
        <p>
            In Flow Layouts, inline elements can be assigned a <code>vertical-align: 
                baseline | sub | super | text-top | text-bottom | middle | top | bottom
            </code>. This will control how the element lines up with the other inline elements.
        </p>

        <div class="visualpreview">
            Text <span style="vertical-align: sub">sub</span>
            <span style="vertical-align: super;">super</span>
        </div>

        <p>
            Aligning inline elements vertically with respect to the parent element 
            can be done by adding padding to the parent like <code>padding-top: 50%;</code>.
            This isn't perfect; the element's top edge will be centered.
            Another imperfect way of doing this is setting <code>font-size</code> to the 
            height of the container. This only works if you have one line of text though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flow Layout isn't really meant for vertical centering.
            Using a flexbox, grid or table with expanding cells is an alternative.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Position">Position</h2>

        <p>
            There are some things that can't be acheived with layouts alone.
            The <code>position</code> property can be used with 
            <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, 
            <code>right</code>, and <code>z-index</code> to bend some of css' rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, most elements are <code>position: static;</code>
            meaning that they move with the normal flow of the document.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>position: relative;</code> will offset the element from the 
            position it would have been by default. 
            <code>position: relative; top: 5px;</code> will move the element 10 pixels 
            down from wherever it was going to be drawn. This doesn't affect 
            any other elements.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>position: absolute;</code> lets you draw the element relative to 
            (in most cases) it's parent container. This means the element will still 
            scroll with the content behind it, but no space will be allocated for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Notably, this creates the possibility of some elements being on top of
            others in an undesired order. To specify this, use the <code>z-index</code>
            property. Lower indexes are drawn earlier in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context" target="_blank">stacking context</a>.

        <p>
            <code>position: fixed;</code> elements will be drawn relative to the 
            viewport. If you want a pay wall on your website, this is what you want.

        <p>
            <code>position: sticky</code> elements will get <q>stuck</q> to a specified 
            edge of the screen when scrolling. <code>position: sticky; top: 10px;</code>
            will stick the 
            element 10 pixels from the to of the screen.

            When using these things, it's important to think about how they could 
            interfere with content when the page is scaled. <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#try_it">Mozilla</a> also has a 
            beautiful demonstration of these properties I can't recreate.

            <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>
            can also be used to specify size of an element. If <code>width: auto;</code>, 
            setting <code>left: 0px; right: 0px;</code> will set the width of the element
            to fill the space. If <code>width</code> had been specified absolutely though,
            the element would have been positioned on either the left or right depending 
            on the language direction of the document.

        <h2>Accessibility in Layouts</h2>
        <p>
            Blind people still use the internet. HTML documents are analyzed 
            by software and read aloud to them. This software depends on the 
            document following accessibility standards in its design.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important that the specific variants of <code>div</code> are 
            used correctly. <code>nav</code> contains links to other pages
            as seen on the left. There is only one <code>nav</code> per page.
            <code>main</code> holds the primary content on the page (there is 
            also only one). <code>article</code> marks content that could exist independently from 
            the rest of the page. <code>footer</code> contains stuff at the bottom,
            <code>header</code> at the top, <code>section</code> breaks apart long 
            documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's definately not all of them. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">Mozilla</a> 
            has written about accessibility 
            extensively.

            Throwing your site into an <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/" target="_blank">accessibility checker</a>
            will reveal many of the things you're not doing.
