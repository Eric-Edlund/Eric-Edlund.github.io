        <h1>Adding Content</h1>
        <p>
            Instead of going over all elements in HTML,
            I'm going 
            to explain generally how elements behave. 
            A list of all elements, or a specific element
            from a description of what you want, is only a google away.
        </p>


        <h2 id="TextBasedElements">Text Based Elements</h2>
        <p>Text formatting in HTML is done by using elements. 
            The header above this paragraph, for example, is written
    <code text="<h3>Text Based Elements</h3>"></code> and the text for this paragraph
 is contained in a <code text="<p>...</p>"></code> element.
        Newline and tab characters typed inside the html document are ignored;
        elements tell the browser how it should space out the text.
</p>

    <table style="width: 100%;">
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h1>"></code></td>
            <td><h1>Header 1</h1></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h2>"></code></td>
            <td><h2>Header 2</h2></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h3>"></code></td>
            <td><h3>Header 3</h3></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h4>"></code></td>
            <td><h4>Header 4</h4></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h5>"></code></td>
            <td><h5>Header 5</h5></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<p>"></code></td>
            <td><p>Paragraph</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<br>"></code></td>
            <td>line<br>break</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<strong>"></code></td>
            <td><strong>Makes text stand out</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<i>"></code></td>
            <td><i>Italicizes text</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<pre>"></code></td>
            <td><pre>Respects text formatting 
                done in html
                   including font, 
                new lines, and  tabs
            </pre></td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p>
        
        There are other text elements, but these are most of what you'll use.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Divisions">Divisions</h2>
    <p>
        Some elements exist only to contain others. <code text="<div></div>"></code> creates a 
        <q>division</q> that can group elements.
    </p>
    <div class="visualpreview" style="align-content: left; ">
        <button style="display: inline;">Button</button>
        <p>Explanation of button</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The above white div separates the button and it's explanation from the rest of the page.
        There are other variants of div for specific areas of your page,
        like <code text="nav"></code> and <code text="main"></code>, which should be used to 
        contain content in the nagivation and main areas of your page. The <code>nav</code> is 
        on the left 
        of this page and topic is in the <code>main</code>.
        This is useful for organization and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        While some elements like <code text="div"></code> are intended specifically 
        to organize your content, there is nothing stopping you from using other 
        elements similarly. <code text="div"></code> div exists solely for 
        organization, but other elements will behave similarly when given child elements.
        For example, the paragraph element <code text="<p>"></code> will further indent child 
        paragraph elements making sub-paragraphs.    
     </p>

    <h2 id="Attributes">Element Attributes</h2>

    <p>
        Elements often have <strong>attributes</strong> 
        associated with them, written in the opening tag.
        They provide information to the element about its behavior.
        Consider this anchor element (a link):
    </p>
    <p>
        <code text='<a href="www.google.com">Link to Google</a>'></code>
        -> <a href="www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Attributes are written <code>key="value"</code> like 
            in <code>href="www.google.com"</code>.
        Multiple attributes are specified with spaces between them.
        There are a few types of attributes I'll go over:
    </p>

    <h3>URLs</h3>

    <p> 
        Uniform Resource Locator strings are the street addresses of computers.
        They can point to websites,
        files, and even specific places on your website.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="facebook.com/Google/">facebook.com/Google/</a> is an <strong>absolute</strong> URL. 
        You could copy 
        it into your browser's search bar and you would end up on Google's Facebook page. An 
        <strong>absoute</strong> url leaves no question about where it's pointing 
        to because it has no context. 
        It has the domain <q>facebook.com</q> which points to Facebook's 
        servers, and the path <q>/Google/</q> which says exactly what page 
        on their servers it wants
         (Google's Facebook page in this case).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Relative</strong> URLs lack an explicit domain, leaving it up to context.
        Usually, the path given is interpreted to be relative to the current 
        file directory of the html file on the host computer. A relative 
        URL inside an html file will search the file system starting at the directory 
        of the HTML file. This page's file structure looks like this:
    </p>

    <iframe src="../" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 2;"></iframe>

    <p>
        The topics in the navigation panel on this page are anchor elements.
        The anchor for this lesson is in the index.html document, and has 
        <code t="href='topics/adding_content.html'"></code>, which points to the 
        HTML file for this lesson. Relative to the index.html file, this lesson is 
        stored in the <code>topics</code> directory.
    </p>

    <h3><code>href</code> vs <code>src</code></h3>

    <p>
        <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> attributes both take a URL and are 
        present in multiple elements. They have a slight semantic difference.
        <code>src</code> is used for substitution. In the <code>img</code>
        element, the content of the image is specified with <code>src</code>
        because the image will fill the content of the <code>img</code>.
        The browser stops for every <code>src</code> element to try and 
        fetch the content before going on reading the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>href</code> specifies a refrence to an external resource.
        Parsing of the page isn't stopped while we fetch the resource.
        <code>a</code> (anchor element) uses <code>href</code> because 
        the content stored at the link doesn't replace anything in the page.
    </p>

    <h3><code>id</code></h3>

    <p>
        The <code>id</code> attribute can be specified on any element.
        As the name suggests, its value is a identifier, unique among other
        ids specified on the page. This is useful for refrencing objects later.
    </p>
    <p>
        A URL pointing to a webpage can have a <strong>fragment</strong> suffix
        which refrences a specific 
        element within the webpage by its <code>id</code>.
        In the navigation section of the left of this page, the subheadings bring you to 
        a specific section in a topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <q>Element Attributes</q> subheading is written 
        <code t='<a href="topics/adding_content.html#Attributes"></a>'></code>.
        That's the address of this topic, suffixed by a <code>#</code>
        and the <code>id</code> specified in the <q>Element Attributes</q> 
        header element of this lesson, <code><q>Attributes</q></code>.
        When the link is clicked, the browser loads that page and then scrolls
        to the element refrenced in the URL.
    </p>

    <h3>Special Value Attributes</h3>

    <p>
        Many elements have unique attributes with a set of allowed values.
        An example of this is the <code>target</code> attribute in the 
        <code>a</code> element, which determines where the link will be opened.
        Here are all possible values:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>_blank</td>
            <td>Opens the link in a new tab.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_self</td>
            <td>Opens the link in current view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_parent</td>
            <td> Opens the link in the parent frame.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_top</td>
            <td>Replaces the current tab's content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>framename</td>
            <td>Opens the linked document in the iframe element with the attribute 
                <code>name=framename</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="Frames">Frames</h2>
 
    <iframe src="adding_content.html" style="float: right; margin: 8px; height: 40ch; border: 1px solid black;"></iframe>

    <p>
        Frames contain their own HTML, allowing for modularity in pages.
        I have put this lesson in an iframe to the right.
        The rectangle containing the normal sized lesson is also in an iframe.
        When you click a topic in the navigation, the content of this iframe 
        is replaced with the lesson you asked for.
        This lets me keep all the lessons organized in separate HTML files.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>iframe</code> element displays the url given by the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>
    <p>There's some controversy online about if iframes should be used or not.
        I haven't dug far into it, but it looks like <code text="<iframe>"></code> 
        is the current way to do this, and <code text="<frame>"></code> is depreciated.
    </p>
