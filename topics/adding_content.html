        <h1>Adding Content</h1>
        <p>
            Instead of going over all elements in HTML,
            I'm going 
            to explain generally how elements behave. 
            A list of all elements, or a specific element
            from a description of what you want, is only a google away.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some elements exist only to contain others. <code text="<div></div>"></code> creates a 
            <q>division</q> which contains other elements and can control how they're orgnized.
            Elements like <code text="nav"></code> and <code text="main"></code> should be used to 
            contain content in the nagivation and main areas of your page. 
            This is useful for organization and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some elements like <code text="div"></code> are intended specifically 
            to organize your content, there is nothing stopping you from using other 
            elements similarly. <code text="div"></code> div exists solely for 
            organization, but other elements will behave similarly when given child elements.
            For example, the paragraph element <code text="<p>"></code> will further indent child 
            paragraph elements making sub-paragraphs.     </p>



        <h2 id="TextBasedElements">Text Based Elements</h2>
        <p>Text formatting in html is done by using elements. 
            In html, the header above this paragraph is written
    <code text="<h3>Text Based Elements</h3>"></code> and the text for this paragraph
 is contained in a <code text="<p>...</p>"></code> element.
            Newline and tab characters inside the html document are ignored. 
        These tags tell the browser how it should space out the text.
</p>

    <table style="width: 100%;">
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h1>"></code></td>
            <td><h1>Header 1</h1></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h2>"></code></td>
            <td><h2>Header 2</h2></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h3>"></code></td>
            <td><h3>Header 3</h3></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h4>"></code></td>
            <td><h4>Header 4</h4></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<h5>"></code></td>
            <td><h5>Header 5</h5></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<p>"></code></td>
            <td><p>Paragraph</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<br>"></code></td>
            <td>line<br>break</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<strong>"></code></td>
            <td><strong>Makes text stand out</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<i>"></code></td>
            <td><i>Italicizes text</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code text="<pre>"></code></td>
            <td><pre>Respects text formatting 
                done in html
                   including font, 
                new lines, and  tabs
            </pre></td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p>
        There are other text elements, but these are most of what you'll use.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Attributes">Element Attributes</h2>

    <p>
        Elements often have multiple <strong>attributes</strong> associated with them.
    </p>
    <p><code text='<a href="www.google.com">Link to Google</a>'></code>
        <a href="www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Attributes are written <code>key="value"</code> like 
            in <code>href="www.google.com"</code> or <code>src="page.html"</code>.
        They're separated by spaces and their value
    </p>

    <h3 id="Anchors"><a href="adding_content.html#Anchors">Anchor</a></h3>

    <p>Anchors (links) take the user to another page. *usually</p>
    <p>
        The <code t="href"></code> attribute specifies the target URL of the link. 
        Uniform Resource Locator strings can, among other things, access other websites,
         other html files, and specific places on your website.
    </p>

<aside>
    <h4>URLs</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="facebook.com/Google/">facebook.com/Google/</a> is an <strong>absolute</strong> URL. 
        You could copy 
        it into your browser's search bar and you would end up on Google's Facebook page. An 
        <strong>absoute</strong> url, like this one, leaves no question about where it's pointing 
        to. It has the domain <q>facebook.com</q> which points to Facebook's 
        servers, and then the path <q>/Google/</q> which says exactly what page <strong>on their servers</strong> it wants
         (Google's Facebook page in this case).
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, there are <strong>relative</strong> URLs, which lack a domain.
        The URL's path is interpreted differently depending on where it is. A relative 
        url inside an html file will search the file system starting at the directory 
        of the html file. This page's file structure looks like this:
    </p>

    <iframe src="../" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 2;"></iframe>

    <p>
        The topics in the topic navigation panel on this page are anchor elements.
        The anchor for this class is in the main.html document, and has 
        <code t="href='topics/adding_content.html'"></code>, which points to the 
        html file for this lesson. Relative to the main.html file, this lesson is 
        stored in the topics directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also relevant is that URLs have a fragment suffix which refrences a specific 
        element within the webpage. The heading for this section is written 
        <code t="<a href='adding_content.html#Anchors'></a>"></code>. Clicking it will 
        instruct the browser to take us to the adding_content.html page and scroll 
        to the top of the <q>Anchors</q> section. The beginning of a section of a webpage 
        is marked by setting the <code t="id"></code> attribute of any element. In this 
        case, the Header is written:
        <p><code t="<h3>
            <a id='Anchors' href='adding_content.html#Anchors'>Anchors</a>
        </h3>"></code></p>

        This is an <code t="<h3>"></code> header element containing an <code t="<a>"></code>
        anchor element with the id of <q>Anchors</q>, the URL <q>adding_content.html#Anchors</q> 
        and the text <q>Anchors</q>. When clicked, it tells the browser to move the focus 
        to it's self.
    </p>
</aside>

    <p>
        Also, observe how the text inherits formatting from both the parent 
        <code t="<h3>"></code> and the child <code t="<a>"></code> element.
        The result is text that is the size of a 3rd level header with the color 
        and underline of a link. Inheritable properties like this will be important 
        later.
    </p>

    <h4>Targets</h4>

    <p>Anchors also have the <code>target</code> attribute. 
        This specifies what the browser will do to the link.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>_blank</td>
            <td>Opens the link in a new tab.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_self</td>
            <td>Opens the link in current view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_parent</td>
            <td> Opens the link in the parent frame.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_top</td>
            <td>Replaces the current tab's content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>framename</td>
            <td>Opens the linked document in the iframe with the attribute 
                <code>name=framename</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="Images">Images</h3>

    <h3 id="SrcVsHref">src vs href</h3>

    <p>There is a rational behind making the <code>src</code> and <code>href</code> 
    attributes have different names.</p>
    <p>
        <code>href</code> is a shortening of <q>Hyperlink Refrence</q>, and unlike
         <code>src</code>, the resource refrenced doesn't need to be located before 
         the page can load. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="Frames">Frames</h3>
 
    <iframe src="adding_content.html" style="float: right; margin: 8px; height: 40ch; border: 1px solid black;"></iframe>

    <p>Frames contain their own html. They allow modularity in pages.
        This lesson is in a frame, and that frames content is changed
        when you switch lessons. This lets me keep all the lessons 
        in separate html files.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>iframe</code> element displays the url given by the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>
    <p>There's some controversy online about if iframes should be used or not.
        I haven't dug far into it, but it looks like <code text="<iframe>"></code> 
        is the current way to do this, and <code text="<frame>"></code> is depreciated.
    </p>



    <p>
        There are many different elements and each takes different attributes and 
        has different child behavior. I've listed out some of the big ones, but 
        the important thing is that you can find the relevant documentation.
    </p>


    <p>All the elements: anchors, labels, titles, paragraphs, iframes...</p>
    <p>If I decided not to go into attributes in the "Html Douments" section, go over them here </p>
    <p>Mention nesting if I haven't already</p>

    <p>Text based ones,
        then all the others
    </p>
    
    <iframe src="javascript:void(0)" id="frameid" frameborder="0" style="background-color: white; width: 100px; height: 100px;"></iframe>
